# Research Assistant @ CAD Innovation and Engineering Lab
- ## Robotics
    - Developed [SnappyXO](http://snappyxo.com/), a laser-cut design-driven robotics platform that enables designing mechanisms, structures, and robots. 
    - It has successfully raised $16K+ on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/snappyxo-a-design-driven-robotics-education-kit) for a crowdfunding campaign.
    - Organized workshop "Designing, Prototyping and Programming Robot Motions using MotionGen and SnappyXO" at [IDETC 2018](https://archive.asme.org/events/idetccie2018/program/workshops-tutorials) and "Kinematic Summer School" at [IDETC 2019](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/2019kiss).
    - Mentored multiple teams, as part of the Vertically Integrated Projects [(VIP)](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/_team_page/team_page.php?team=Robotics-driven%20Engineering%20Design%20Exploration) program, for Robotics-driven Engineering Design Exploration. Some of the projects were Walking Robots, Self-driving Car, Sumo/Battle Bot, Biomimetic Robots, Drones and Bots with Arduino alternative microcontrollers.
