### “Engineering is the closest thing to magic that exists in the real world”

I'm a Robotics Engineer who loves working on the latest trends in automation. I'm excited about using my interdisciplinary knowledge to solve challenging problems in transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare industry.

I am currently working at Dematic, Kion Mobile Automation as a Machine Learning Engineer. My responsibilities include research and development of robot mapping and localization (SLAM) algorithms for automated guided vehicles(AGVs) in warehouse environments, equipped with sensors like 2D/3D LiDAR, wheel odometry, IMU, and cameras. The software development is mostly done using C++, Python, and Robot Operating System(ROS).

I have a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, focusing on robotics, where I designed algorithms for simulation and synthesis of single-degree-of-freedom closed-loop mechanisms (parallel kinematic robots). During my Ph.D., I also developed SnappyXO, a laser-cut robotics kit to create mechanisms, structures, and robots, which ran a successful crowdfunding campaign. I have also supervised many undergraduates on robotics projects like walking bots, climbing bots, battle bots, biomimetic bots, self-driving cars, and drones. An online mechanism design platform, developed by me, is available here: [http://cadcam.eng.sunysb.edu](http://cadcam.eng.sunysb.edu)

As a part of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree program, I have worked with critical autonomous driving technologies like computer vision, deep learning, sensor fusion, localization, motion planning, behavior, control, and system integration. These projects and more can be found on my GitHub profile: [https://github.com/ssharma1991](https://github.com/ssharma1991) 

On a weekend, you might find me section hiking the Appalachian Trail or camping in the backcountry.
