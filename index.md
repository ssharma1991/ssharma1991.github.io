### “Engineering is the closest thing to magic that exists in the real world” — Elon Musk

I'm a Self Driving Car and Robotics Engineer who loves working on the latest trends in automation. I'm excited about using my interdisciplinary knowledge to solve challenging problems in transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare industry.

In my Ph.D. research at Stony Brook University, I'm working on designing Spatial, Spherical, and Planar robotic systems for motion and path planning. A web-based mechanism design platform, developed by me, is available here: [http://cadcam.eng.sunysb.edu](http://cadcam.eng.sunysb.edu)

Working on Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree program has led me to work on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Sensor Fusion, Localization, Motion Planning, Behavior, Control, and System Integration. Projects implementing these key Autonomous Driving technologies can be found on my GitHub profile: [https://github.com/ssharma1991](https://github.com/ssharma1991) 

On a weekend, you might find me section hiking the Appalachian Trail or camping in the back country.
