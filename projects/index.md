- ### Mechanism Design Software [(link)](https://github.com/ssharma1991/MotionGen-Server)

    - Developing a Computational Framework for Data-Driven Mechanism Design Innovation supported by $450K [NSF grant](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1563413).
    - Created [MotionGen](http://cadcam.eng.sunysb.edu/) a web-based mechanism design framework. 
    - It uses MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack to create a RESTful web service based on MVC architecture. 
    - Both iOS and Android apps have been created using Apache Cordova framework.

- ### Research and Algorithms
    - Path synthesis of mechanisms based on Fourier descriptor fitting using Nelder-Mead and Simulated Annealing optimization.
    - Mixed motion and path mechanism synthesis using optimal non-uniform DFT and Singular Value Decomposition.
    - Real-time simulation of planar, spherical and spatial mechanisms with prismatic and revolute joints using Newton-Raphson optimization.

- ### Robotics
    - Developed [SnappyXO](http://snappyxo.com/), a laser-cut design-driven robotics platform that enables designing mechanisms, structures, and robots. 
    - It has successfully raised $16K+ on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/snappyxo-a-design-driven-robotics-education-kit) for a crowdfunding campaign.
    - Organized workshop "Designing, Prototyping and Programming Robot Motions using MotionGen and SnappyXO" at [IDETC 2018](https://archive.asme.org/events/idetccie2018/program/workshops-tutorials) and "Kinematic Summer School" at [IDETC 2019](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/2019kiss).
